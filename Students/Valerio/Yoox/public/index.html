                        3 September 2012 – Online shoppers can now purchase their favorite outfit simply by speaking to their computer. After launching fashion e-commerce back in early 2000, yoox.com has been completely reinvented and redesigned. As part of its new look, it introduces Speak &amp; Shop™, a revolutionary feature for online fashion where text search meets voice recognition from YOOX Group Technology and R&amp;D divisions - innovation Made in Italy.
                        Millions of visitors from around the globe are welcomed to the NEW yoox.com by its digital cover featuring the famous Chinese top model Xiao Wen Ju wearing a video-dress conceived by mixing fashion with technology.
                        Style and design lovers can search their favorite outfit, shoes, accessories or design objects by simply clicking or writing their favorite color of the season, or by using the feature Speak &amp; Shop™ allowing them to state their preferred color in nine languages (British English, Italian, French, Russian, Spanish, German, US English, Japanese and Korean): the digital cover page will return an edited selection of fashion and design pieces in the desired color. Xiao Wen Ju's kaleidoscopic look too is transformed in the same color, creating a mono-chrome page of products and dreams. Retail therapy meets chromo-therapy – all of course using Google Chrome™.

                        Cutting-edge French design brand Moustache joins forces with the leading virtual store for multi-brand fashion and design in the world, yoox.com, to create an exciting new product - Le Cyclope Ardent, available exclusively on yoox.com from the end of March 2012.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Cyclope mirror, designed by young French designer Ionna Vautrin, gets its name from the convex mirrors, (which in French are called ‘witches' eyes) - Vautrin takes this magical object and perches it atop a soft cone crafted from clay, creating a table-top mirror with a distinctly sculptural feel, evoking the mysterious monolithic statues of far-off primitive cultures or the minimal eloquence of sculptors like Brancusi and Moore. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Originally available in a matt ceramic finish, for yoox.com, Vautrin has created 3 new and unique new versions – Le Cyclope Ardent. Le Cyclope Ardent is coated in a lustrous hi-gloss metallic finish, 3 different metals chosen for their evocative richness, luster and sophistication: opulent gold, elegant platinum and warm, alluring copper. Like a sculpture for the home, Le Cyclope Ardent sits atop any table or desk and gazes out at the world around it, offering users a glimpse into a strange and intriguing vision of the world.
